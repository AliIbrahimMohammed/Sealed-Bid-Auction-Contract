COMMIT PHASE: Bidders submit a hash of their bid amount and secret.\n *    - The commitment is keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bidAmount, secret))\n *    - Only the hash is visible on-chain; the actual bid remains secret\n *    - Prevents front-running and bid manipulation\n * \n * 2. REVEAL PHASE: Bidders reveal their actual bid by providing the\n *    original amount and secret.\n *    - Contract verifies the commitment matches the revealed values\n *    - Invalid reveals are rejected\n * \n * 3. FINALIZATION: The highest valid bid wins the auction.\n * \n * Security Properties:\n * - Front-running Prevention: Bids cannot be seen before commit phase ends\n * - Bid Manipulation Prevention: Cannot change bid after commit\n * - Commitment Binding: Must reveal exactly what was committed\n * \n * Off-chain Commitment Generation:\n * --------------------------------\n * The commitment is generated using:\n *   keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bidAmount, secret))\n * \n * Example (TypeScript/viem):\n *   const commitment = keccak256(\n *     encodePacked([\"uint256\", \"string\"], [bidAmount, secret])\n *   );\n */\ncontract SealedBidAuction is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {\n    uint256 public immutable commitEndTime;\n    uint256 public immutable revealEndTime;\n\n    mapping(address => bytes32) private _commitments;\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _revealedBids;\n    \n    address public winner;\n    uint256 public highestBid;\n    bool public finalized;\n    \n    address[] private _biddersList;\n    mapping(address => bool) private _bidderInList;\n    \n    event BidCommitted(address indexed bidder, bytes32 commitment);\n    event BidRevealed(address indexed bidder, uint256 amount);\n    event AuctionFinalized(address indexed winner, uint256 highestBid);\n    event BidRefunded(address indexed bidder, uint256 amount);\n    \n    error AuctionAlreadyFinalized();\n    error BidderAlreadyCommitted();\n    error BidderAlreadyRevealed();\n    error CommitmentMismatch();\n    error CommitPhaseEnded();\n    error CommitPhaseNotEnded();\n    error InvalidCommitment();\n    error NoCommitmentFound();\n    error NoBidToRefund();\n    error RevealPhaseNotActive();\n    error RevealPhaseNotEnded();\n    error Unauthorized();\n\n    constructor(\n        uint256 commitDuration,\n        uint256 revealDuration,\n        address initialOwner\n    ) Ownable(initialOwner) {\n        commitEndTime = block.timestamp + commitDuration;\n        revealEndTime = commitEndTime + revealDuration;\n    }\n    \n    function commitBid(bytes32 commitment) \n        external \n        onlyDuringCommitPhase \n    {\n        if (commitment == bytes32(0)) revert InvalidCommitment();\n        if (_commitments[msg.sender] != bytes32(0)) revert BidderAlreadyCommitted();\n        \n        _commitments[msg.sender] = commitment;\n        \n        if (!_bidderInList[msg.sender]) {\n            _bidderInList[msg.sender] = true;\n            _biddersList.push(msg.sender);\n        }\n        \n        emit BidCommitted(msg.sender, commitment);\n    }\n    \n    function revealBid(uint256 bidAmount, string calldata secret) \n        external \n        onlyDuringRevealPhase \n        nonReentrant \n    {\n        bytes32 commitment = _commitments[msg.sender];\n        if (commitment == bytes32(0)) revert NoCommitmentFound();\n        if (_revealedBids[msg.sender] != 0) revert BidderAlreadyRevealed();\n        \n        bytes32 computed = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bidAmount, secret));\n        if (computed != commitment) revert CommitmentMismatch();\n        \n        _revealedBids[msg.sender] = bidAmount;\n        \n        emit BidRevealed(msg.sender, bidAmount);\n    }\n    \n    function finalizeAuction() \n        external \n        onlyAfterRevealPhase \n        nonReentrant \n    {\n        if (finalized) revert AuctionAlreadyFinalized();\n        \n        if (msg.sender != owner() && _revealedBids[msg.sender] == 0) {\n            revert Unauthorized();\n        }\n        \n        address highestBidder = address(0);\n        uint256 highest = 0;\n        \n        for (uint256 i = 0;
